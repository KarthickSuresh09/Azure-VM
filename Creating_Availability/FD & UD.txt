In Azure,
FD = Fault Domain
UD = Update Domain

1. FD – Fault Domain
* Meaning: A group of hardware (servers, power, network) that shares the same physical resources in a data center.
* Example in Azure: If you put 3 VMs in an availability set with 2 FDs, 
                    Azure will spread them across the two FDs, so hardware failure doesn’t take all VMs down.


2. UD – Update Domain
* Meaning: A logical group of VMs that can be updated or rebooted at the same time during maintenance.
* Example in Azure: If you have 5 VMs across 5 UDs, Azure updates 1 UD at a time — 4 VMs stay online while 1 is being updated


✅ In short:
FD → Protects against hardware failure.
UD → Protects against planned maintenance downtime.

| VM Name | Fault Domain | Update Domain |
| ------- | ------------ | ------------- |
| VM1     | FD0          | UD0           |
| VM2     | FD1          | UD1           |
| VM3     | FD0          | UD2           |
| VM4     | FD1          | UD0           |
| VM5     | FD0          | UD1           |
| VM6     | FD1          | UD2           |
