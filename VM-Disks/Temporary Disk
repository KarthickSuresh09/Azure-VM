A temporary disk in Azure is a special type of disk that provides fast, 
local storage directly attached to the physical host machine where your VM is running. However, as the name suggests, 
the data on this disk is not persistent and can be lost at any time during events like:

* VM deallocation (stop)
* Host maintenance or hardware failures
* VM resize or restarts

ðŸ”¹ Key Points about Temporary Disk
Feature	Details
Purpose	         Store temporary files like swap space, page file, or app cache
Windows Path	   D:\ drive
Linux Path	     /dev/sdb (usually mounted to /mnt or /mnt/resource)
Persistence	     Not persistent â€” data can be lost
Performance	     Very fast (since it's local SSD storage)
Included Cost	   Free (included with VM pricing)

ðŸ”¸ Typical Uses
âœ… Use temporary disk for:
Pagefile or swap space
Cache
Temp files for apps
Build artifacts that donâ€™t need to be stored

ðŸš« Donâ€™t use it for:
Databases
Persistent application data
Important logs

ðŸ”¹ Example in Windows VM
If you log into a Windows Azure VM, youâ€™ll usually see:
*C:* â†’ OS disk (persistent)
*D:* â†’ Temporary disk (not persistent)
You might see a message like:
"The data on the D: drive will be lost if the virtual machine is stopped (deallocated)."
