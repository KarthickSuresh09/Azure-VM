reason for custom image creation

1. Performance Optimization
Use Case: A smart washing machine runs a custom Linux OS without desktop apps, so it boots in 5 seconds and only runs washing logic.

2. Security & Control
Use Case: A bank ATM’s OS has no browser, no USB drivers, and only runs the ATM software — so hackers can’t install random apps.

3. Hardware Specialization
Use Case: A PlayStation console’s OS is tuned for its custom GPU so games run faster than they would on normal Windows.

4. Compliance & Regulations
Use Case: A self-driving car’s safety system runs a certified OS that meets road safety regulations — it must pass strict tests.

5. Real-Time Processing
Use Case: A robot arm in a factory runs a real-time OS so it reacts to sensor input in milliseconds without delay.

6. Branding & User Experience
Use Case: Samsung Smart TVs run “Tizen OS” so the menu design, features, and app store look unique to Samsung.

7. Cost Reduction
Use Case: A cheap fitness tracker uses FreeRTOS (free) instead of Windows IoT (paid), lowering device cost.
